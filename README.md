Predicting-Diabetes-of-Individuals
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• This project is aimed to be able to predict whether a new individual is a diabetic patient or not by using the health
data of people with diabetes, by using the decision tree learning infrastructure.

• In order to deal with continuous data, algorithms were implemented and cutoff values were determined, if the
incoming cutoff value is smaller, the branch on the left side, if it is greater than the cutoff value, the tree on the
right side is accessed.

• Decision Tree classifier has been directly implemented, ready-made libraries were not used
